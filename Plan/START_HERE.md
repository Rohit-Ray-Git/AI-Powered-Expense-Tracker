## 💰 Cost Timeline

| Phase | Cumulative Cost | Monthly | Justification |
|-------|-----------------|---------|---------------|
| MVP | $70 | - | VPS + basic Claude API |
| Phase 2 | $120 | - | Adds ML compute, still on 1 VPS |
| Phase 3 | $150 | - | Still single VPS |
| v1.0 | $150-200 | $60-130 | VPS + Claude API monthly |

**Bottom line:** ~$150 to launch MVP, then $80-130/month ongoing (for 1,000+ users)
